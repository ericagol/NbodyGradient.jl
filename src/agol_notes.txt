Implementing Wisdom & Hernandez (2015) Universal Kepler solver.

So far it doesn't seem to converge as fast as a standard Kepler
solver for the elliptic case.

8/9/17
Okay, elliptic case seems to work, and one iteration of quartic
extrapolation gets me within ~machine precision!

Now for hyperbolic case...  I need to rederive everything.
WH's small-angle concern I don't think is a big issue in practice
(of course, unless there is a large period ratio so that outer
planets have to take small steps... maybe I should stick to
half-angles).

Also need to code up parabolic case (cubic equation):

y(s) = s^3 + 3*r0*s^2*dr0dt/k + 6r0*s/k -6h/k
     = s^3 + a s^2 + b s + c
   with a = 3*r0*dr0dt/k, b=6*r0/k, c = -6h/k

Q = r0^2*dr0dt^2/k^2 - 2r0/k
R = r0^3*dr0dt^3/k^3 - 3*r0^2*dr0dt/k^2 - 3*h/k

Q: If there are three real roots, which one do we choose?

8/10/2017
Okay, I got the hyperbolic case working!

Now, for the parabolic (although this should almost never occur in practice...).

Problem: quickly get NaNs since beta becomes slightly less than
zero (presumably due to rounding error).

Okay, got parabolic case working.  It is called if beta is within ~10^{-15}
of zero.

8/11/2017
Not sure what is going on with allocations...  this seems to always
trip me up.  Dan figured out how to rewrite celerite without as
much memory allocation;  it might be worth looking at that code.

10^6 steps in 4-5 seconds;  not great compared with what Hernandez finds.
Wonder if this is related to the memory allocation problem?

8/12/2017
Why is test_elliptic getting zeros back for r & beta_final???!

Julia is a mystery...

8/12/2017
test_elliptic.jl gives ~0.2 \mu sec for each call to kepler_solver_elliptic.
For 800 days of trappist-1, this gives ~800/1.5*20*28*2e-7 ~ 0.06 sec; not
great.... plus, this could be higher since FB algorithm takes steps
back & forth, and there may be more than one iteration in some cases.

8/14/2017
Okay, so I have some problems with Julia:
1).  If I pass out a tuple, then this is handled with type-unstable operations, slowing things down.
2).  If there are variables which I pass through, then these are type-unstable.
3).  But, otherwise I need to define new variables in the routine, which takes overhead.

I tried using a Type to bundle these, but then I need to instantiate the type within the
routine, which takes too much time.

There has to be some way to pre-allocate variables for Julia so I don't have to waste time
defining variables all of the time!

Okay, so I settled on passing a state vector - this avoids the need to define a new type -
and then I just save the final state at the end of the step to this vector.  Not as elegant
or readable, but it's the fastest yet: 0.2 microseconds per Kepler step (one iteration).

8/15/2017

I corrected a mistake in comp_ds_opt, and made some other other changes
to decrease the number of operations.  Reduced speed by ~10%.

When I take larger timesteps, the total run time doesn't grow significantly
with two iterations per step.

I wonder if it would be quicker to solve cubic equation for the initial step guess? [ ]

Okay, I've rewritten kepler_solver_hyperbolic.jl, and now combined
kepler_solver_elliptic.jl and kepler_solver_hyperbolic.jl into kepler_solver.jl
(they use the function in common calc_cs_opt).

Both seem to preserve beta well, and take about 0.3 microseconds for each step
when the eccentricity is modest!

Onward to carrying out symplectic integrator:

1). Figure out COM coordinates & drift operations.
2). Figure out how to compute whether a transit has occured.
3). Figure out cartesian coordinates.
4). Write the basic operator code for a pair of planets.

8/30/2017

1). See whether I can reproduce Hernandez' code in Julia, and try out the
eccentric binary planet problem. [x]
2). Does cubic initial estimate speed things up, or slow it down? [ ]
3). Then, figure out TTVs and benchmark. [x]

Then, try it out for a planet-moon system orbiting a binary star! [ ]

Okay, I've translated nbody.c to nbody.jl (with a bit more work needed for the
main function).  Next, I need to try running to see if it gives same results with
my Kepler solver!

8/31/2017
Okay, I got the Julia translation done.  Now for debugging next!

Code seems to be debugged, and agrees (for the most part) with David's. [x]

Next, I need to
1). Add in extrapolation of s from prior steps; [x] (Doesn't speed it up at all!)
2). Enable finding transit times; [x]
3). Set up initial conditions. [x]
    - This involves coming up with a means of specifying a hierarchical N-body system.
Then, take derivatives, and optimize fits to T-1!

9/5/2017

Okay, now I need to set up the initial conditions.  I'm planning
to use the parentheses notation from Milani & Nobili (1983),
and to use the matrix notation of Hamers & Portegies Zwart (2016).

Tasks:
1).  Parse the hierarchy.  [x] (sort of - just for planetary configuration)
2).  Compute the A matrix. [x]
3).  Invert the matrix.    [x]
4).  Compute the semi-major axis for each Kepler problem. [x]
5).  Compute the cartesian elements & velocities for each Keplerian. [x]
6).  Compute the initial positions & velocities. [x]
7).  Couple to the integrator. [x]
8).  Compute transit times. [x]

9/7/2017
Problem: consq! isn't modifying L0, p0 or xcm0.
Solution: switched to fill! rather than zeros(NDIM) in consq!

Now, it seems to be working!  Energy is conserved to ~4x10^-7 for a step size
of 0.15 days.

Idea:  Make a plot of the barycentric motion of the star with time. [x]

This looks pretty cool!

9/8/2017
Okay, got a routine working which computes TTVs, and they look qualitatively
similar to Simon Grimm's code(!).

Next steps:
1).  Optimize code, and figure out some way to check that it is working correctly. [x]
2).  Compute transit time derivatives with respect to initial elements
(either analytically, or with autodiff). [ ]
3).  Optimize the fit to the latest transit times for the paper. [x]
4).  Figure out how to run a Markov chain. [ ]

Checking the convergence with time step, there appear to be (t0,P) offsets
(possibly because there is no corrector applied for the integrator), but
for TRAPPIST-1, the TTV appear to be converged to <3 sec precision for
a time step of 0.05 days (about 1/30 of the period of the inner planet).
This should be sufficient given the precision of the measurements.

Right now the run time is prohibitively slow!  0.4 seconds... and there doesn't
appear to be much to optimize - the profile looked fairly clean.  I could possibly
get another factor of 2 in speed-up if I implement the extrapolation of s, and
if I can converge in ~1 iteration rather than two. [ ]  Another possibility would
be to only include adjacent planets' perturbations, which may give another
factor of ~2.8 speed-up. [ ]  I should also figure out how long the transit-time
computation is taking:  in practice I'll only need to compute the observed
transit times, which may save a bit. [ ] Overall, though, rather disappointing:
I was hoping to obtain ~msec speed.

I need to see how long the other version(s) of TTVFast are taking, and I should also 
ask Simon how long his integrator takes. [x]

Otherwise the only way to get additional speed is to figure out how to improve
TTVFaster (which seems impossible), or to figure out how to make TTVFast parallel
(also daunting).  Analytic derivatives may help with optimization, which I should
look into next, both with autodiff [ ] and with propagating derivative. [ ]

The other possibility is to compute a grid of models, and
to fit these with a quadratic function of the transit times.  This approach
seems promising, so I'll look into it next week. [x] Nope, didn't work.

I also need to look into the coordinate system to make sure I'm transforming
correctly. [ ]

Another to do: Figure out a corrector/inverse corrector for this map. [x] Too hard.
But, David shared code for 4th order integrator.

To do:
1). Compute derivatives. [x] Numerically [ ] Analytically.
2). Optimize model to TRAPPIST-1. [x]
3). Perturb parameters; see if we can find a quadratic fit to transit times
as a function of the starting parameters. [x]
4). With quadratic fit, carry out an MCMC analysis. [x]

9/11/2017

Not much success with any of the next steps yet.

The initial times of transit seem to change wildly when the initial t_0 values
change by a small amount.  Perhaps I need to make sure that the t0 values are defined
early on.

Found a bug: omega was being converted to radians from degrees, while it was starting
in radians.  This helps to fix the starting t0; now this matches better.  I also
now define the t0 values close to the start of the integration.

Problem:  How do we carry out a linearization with respect to the initial parameters
while guaranteeing somehow that the transit times aren't too far off of the correct
values?  Should we try to expand in harmonics of adjacent planets?

9/12/2017

Next, going to try autodiff on the various functions, and see what it comes up with.

9/20/2017
I'm making progress on differentiable function...

9/21/2017

Okay, I got the derivatives working for the Kepler stepper!

The numerically computed jacobian agrees to ~10^-6 with analytically computed!

Just run:

include("test_elliptical_derivative.jl")

So, remaining steps are to test the hyperbolic case,
do center-of-mass conversion, differentiate drifts,
implement higher order integrator, differentiate initial conditions,
and differentiate transit time finding.  Then, write routines to put all of this together
and write a Hamiltonian markov chain monte carlo code. [ ]

9/27/2017
I'm having trouble getting the derivatives to work out...
Need to revisit with fresh mind.

Seems to be working for the planet in x-z plane!
But, still not working for the star, nor for the y-axis (although this may
be due to the fact that system is edge-on).

There seems to be a sign error in the mass derivative. [x]

9/28/2017
Okay, I debugged the two-body Kepler derivative!  There were a few problems: 1). my
derivation used the opposite sign of David's; 2). I was adding in the x-vector to
every component of the derivative matrix, while it should have been diagonal.

I ended up tilting the system to give better estimates of derivatives, and it seems
to be working great!

10/4/2017
I wrote a version which used Kat's interpolation scheme rather than mine;  this
is somewhat better defined since the states are real.

I also implemented Dehnen & Hernandez' 4th order integrator - this gives more
precision for all of the planets, allowing smaller time steps, and thus better
precision with less computing time!  However, it's going to be more difficult
to differentiate.

10/5/2017
Okay, let's get the derivatives to work with the phi^2/DH17 mapping.

10/6/2017
In profiling, it looks like ~1/3 of the time is spent in allocating memory for temporary
arrays.  It seems like this should be possible to fix.

10/17/2017
Okay, for transit time finding I'm now doing a full integration over a fraction of
a step.  This has the advantage that it will work for any hierarchical configuration.
It also has the advantage that it gives higher precision for the transit times, and
makes the derivative computation slightly simpler.  It has the disadvantage that it
takes longer to run, but only by ~30-50%.

10/19/2017

Need to test the hyperbolic kepler case. [x]

There's a weird bug occurring:  test_dh17.jl fails for jac_step[1:3,:,7,:],
but it doesn't fail for test_elliptic_derivative.jl.  I need to track down what
is different about these. [x]

Hmmm.... it works when there are only two bodies.  Somehow the third body
is affecting the solution when we only advance the first two.... weird.

10/20/2017

Okay, I think I know what is going on:  the jacobian for the keplerij! routine
is not computed properly when the center-of-mass is non-zero.  I tried putting
in 3 bodies for test_elliptic_derivative.jl, and found that this gave errors as
well!

The problem was that xcm was the initial center-of-mass position;  I needed to
include the final center-of-mass position.

Once I added that, keplerij works with 3 bodies!  Then, I added back in the
other steps of dh17, and now test_dh17.jl gives good results!

Next steps:

1).  Concatenate multiple steps, and test these. [x]
2).  Write transit time derivative, and test. [x]
3).  Write initial condition derivative, and test. [ ]
4).  Profile code & see if there are ways to speed it up. [ ]

Implemented transit-time derivatives;  now need to test if this works.

11/6/2017
Okay, got the TTV derivatives working!  I found a couple of bugs:
1). Findtransit2 had the wrong jacobian element in the last line computing dtdq.
2). Incrementing of time step should happen at *end* of step, not beginning.

test_ttv_derivative.jl now loops over differnet dlnq values and takes double-sided
derivatives for an accurate comparison of the numerical derivative with the
analytic (since I expect the latter to be much more accurate).  It looks like
the derivatives agree well, to better than 10% for the TRAPPIST-1 example case.

So, I think the derivatives are being computed properly, and we can move on to
the next steps.

11/7/2017
The code is spending a *lot* of time in jac_multiply! & jac_multiplyij!
(70% in the n=8 TRAPPIST-1 example)!  I tried using the matrix multiply
function, which seems to give the same answer for each step, but when
I use it over multiple time steps, causes bad results due to a bug
that I have yet to identify.  My attempt at this is stored in ttv_square.jl
(since the jacobian is stored in a 2x2 square matrix rather than the
4-index matrix).

All to say: perhaps the code can be refactored to improve the speed
by a factor of 2-3.  I also should look at conserving memory allocation
as well.

But, this seems to be working for now, so I'll move on to the next
step which is taking derivatives of the initial conditions.

I tried to speed up ttv.jl by doing matrix multiplication with built-in
function.  However, what happens is bizarre:  the line that carries out
the matrix multiplication is evaluated quickly, while the profile shows
that the actual matrix multiplication isn't carried out until the
result is assigned to another matrix!  This is why this wasn't working
before, I think.

For the TRAPPIST-1 test case, I get about a 40% speed-up using matrix
multiplication (for n=8; less for n=3), which is pretty good, but not 
as good as I had been expecting.  So, ttv_square.jl is indeed faster,
but not by a whole lot.

Array allocation in compute_jacobian seems to be taking a *lot* of
time, about 5% in total.  Perhaps fill!(xxx,0.0) would be similarly
slow...

11/13/2017
Things to do:
1).  Generalize for inclined planets. [x] (I generalized kepler_init).
 1b). Check that initial t0 & P gives correct ephemeris in 2-body (Kepler) case. [ ]
2).  Generalize for arbitrary mobile diagram.  [ ]
3).  Compare with rebound. [ ]
4).  Check coordinates. [ ]
5).  Finish derivatives of initial conditions. [x]
6).  Allow output of derivatives of positions/velocities at arbitrary time steps
for RV, astrometry, etc. [ ]
7).  Have TTV call with Cartesian coordinates, and write wrapper for elements. [x]
8).  Figure out derivatives of kepler_init. [x]
9).  Figure out derivatives of init_nbody. [x]
10). Write a differentiable photodynamical model. [ ]

11/14/2017
Found that using BLAS.gemm! and careful copying of matrices reduces time
for 8-body case by another ~60%.  Now the derivatives take only a factor of 
~8 times longer to evaluate in the 8-body case (which is for 56 free parameters!).
So, this is ~14x faster than evaluating 2-side numerical derivatives, and
much more accurate as well (in the 8-body case;  appears to scale with nbody).

I'm ready to swap ttv_square.jl for ttv.jl, and retire ttv.jl. [x]

11/20/2017
Got kepler_init working with computing the initial Jacobian.  Still need to
modify it for the e=0 case. [ ]

Moving on to obtaining full derivative of initial conditions.

11/30/2017
Okay, initial condition derivative is almost working.  Still have an
error for the mass derivatives, which needs to be fixed. [x]
Mixed up k & i in mass derivatives; fixed init_nbody.jl; now it works!!!

Last step is to multiply derivatives of TTVs wrt initial Cartesian coordinates
times the Jacobian of the initial Cartesian coordinates wrt orbital elements,
at which point we'll have the full derivatives. [x]

12/1/2017
Got full derivatives working - test_ttv_elements.jl runs this.

1/10/2018

Right now the tests have worse precision for the timing derivatives than
I would like.  Using findtransit3, the precisions are:
